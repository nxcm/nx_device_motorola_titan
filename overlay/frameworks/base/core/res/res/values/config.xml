    <!-- ComponentName of a dream to show whenever the system would otherwise have
         gone to sleep.  When the PowerManager is asked to go to sleep, it will instead
         try to start this dream if possible.  The dream should typically call startDozing()
         to put the display into a low power state and allow the application processor
         to be suspended.  When the dream ends, the system will go to sleep as usual.
         Specify the component name or an empty string if none.

         Note that doze dreams are not subject to the same start conditions as ordinary dreams.
         Doze dreams will run whenever the power manager is in a dozing state. -->

         turned off and the screen off animation has been performed. -->

    <!-- Power Management: Specifies whether to decouple the auto-suspend state of the
         device from the display on/off state.

         When false, autosuspend_disable() will be called before the display is turned on
         and autosuspend_enable() will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices using legacy power management
         features such as early suspend / late resume.

         When true, autosuspend_display() and autosuspend_enable() will be called
         independently of whether the display is being turned on or off.  This mode
         enables the power manager to suspend the application processor while the
         display is on.

         This resource should be set to "true" when a doze component has been specified
         to maximize power savings but not all devices support it.

         Refer to autosuspend.h for details.

         device from the display on/off state.

         When false, setInteractive(..., true) will be called before the display is turned on
         and setInteractive(..., false) will be called after the display is turned off.
         This mode provides best compatibility for devices that expect the interactive
         state to be tied to the display state.

         When true, setInteractive(...) will be called independently of whether the display
         is being turned on or off.  This mode enables the power manager to reduce
         clocks and disable the touch controller while the display is on.

         This resource should be set to "true" when a doze component has been specified
         to maximize power savings but not all devices support it.

         dozing).  This should be enabled if you have such services and expect apps to
